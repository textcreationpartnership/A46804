            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>BEloved</hi> Chriſtian Friends <hi>and Brethren, ſeeing God hath</hi> ſo mercifully <hi>appointed us to live in theſe</hi> precious, Goſpel-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging <hi>times, for which we have</hi> unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>cauſe to</hi> magnify <hi>and</hi> reverence <hi>his Holy Name; This being the laſt age of the World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more eſpecially,</hi> the Vaile <hi>is to be</hi> rent, <hi>and the</hi> greateſt <hi>glory to be revealed. In order whereunto,</hi> this Generation <hi>have ſeen, the many</hi> multiplyed wonders <hi>of the Lord, ſuch as our Fathers, (nay, ſuch as no Generations) ever ſaw, which although</hi> ſome <hi>will not</hi> ſee, <hi>yet</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>they ſhall ſee; even his mighty</hi> out-ſtretched <hi>arm, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> now <hi>his people out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>even through the Sea and Wilderneſs, to enjoy the</hi> promiſed Land, <hi>wherein his Name</hi> alone <hi>ſhall be exalted, to the utter</hi> ſtaining <hi>the glory of</hi> all fleſh, <hi>and all that is</hi> of <hi>fleſh; For, the glory of the Lord</hi> approacheth near, <hi>and happy are</hi> the Virgins <hi>that are made</hi> ready <hi>to enter with the</hi> Bridegroom: <hi>and</hi> bleſſed are <hi>thoſe Servants,</hi> that watch for their Maſters coming and keep their garments about them, that they be not found na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and their ſhame appear; <hi>for,</hi> to all <hi>ſuch, he will come upon them</hi> ſuddenly <hi>in an hour</hi> when they think not, and will cut them in pieces, and give them their portion with Hypocrites; <hi>For, without queſtion,</hi> the day of the Lord is at hand, <hi>and cometh</hi> as a Thief: <hi>How often is this</hi> reiterated, <hi>and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt even becauſe, men are ſo apt to</hi> ſlumber &amp; ſleep, <hi>The conſideration hereof, hath conſtrained us, even by all</hi> helps <hi>and</hi> means <hi>to ſtir up and awake one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before this glorious day of the Lord comes; that we may be aware of his coming and</hi> our eyes <hi>may be</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Petitionary letter <hi>was, not long ſince, ſent to Mr.</hi> Will. Jenkins <hi>and others therein named; ſent</hi> in time <hi>but hearkned to, almoſt too Late; they incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Mr. Love to lead the way and he them, to follow him: but they are better adviſed: This letter, at firſt, was intended,</hi> only <hi>as a private ſupplication to him, but ſeeing</hi> ſo many others, <hi>were carryed away; in the ſame paths, ſubſcribing with him and laboring</hi> mightily <hi>to enflame this nation again, in a third War, upon a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95150:3"/>hazzard <hi>to obtain their own ends: but, had they</hi> fully prevailed, <hi>what had become of all their diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting brethren, though never ſo godly? we fear, they ſhould have had, but</hi> hard meaſure <hi>for all the</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>and</hi> patience <hi>ſhewed to them: nor ſhould they, have enjoyed, ſuch</hi> pardons, priviledges, and quiet habitations <hi>among them, as they enjoy among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Lord himſelf, of his</hi> unſpeakable <hi>mercy, having ſtopped that</hi> current of blood <hi>intended and begun: Hereupon, ſome have begun, (better late then never) to ſee and confeſs their errors and</hi> ſinful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages: <hi>Particularly, Mr.</hi> Will.

(If we ſhall ſay no more)</hi> to ſave <hi>their Carkaſes, they have diſſembled with God and men, having taken his name in vain and abuſed his people: herein to clear themſelves is of very great concernment.</hi>

            <head>To the Supream Authority, the Parliament of the Common-wealth OF ENGLAND: The Humble Petition of <hi>William Jenkin,</hi> Priſoner:</head>
            <opener>Most humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner, is unfainedly ſorrowful for all his late miſcarriages, whether teſtified againſt him or acknowledged by him, and for the great and ſinful unſuitableneſs of them to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and condition. That upon earneſt ſeeking of God, and diligent inquiring into his will, your Petitioner is convinced, that the alteration of civil Governments, are ordered by, and founded upon the wiſe and righteous providences of God, who removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings, ruleth in the Kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will. That the providences of this God, have in the judgment of your Petitioner, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared in the removing of others from, and the inveſting your honors with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Nation, as ever they appeared in the taking away, or beſtowing of any Government in any Hiſtory of any age of the world.</p>
            <p>That he apprehends that a refuſal to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this preſent Authority, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of upholding the title of any one upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95150:6"/>Earth, is a refuſal to acquieſs in the wiſe and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous pleaſure of God, ſuch an oppoſing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſet up by the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, as none can have peace, either in acting or ſuffering for; and that your Petitioner looks upon it as his duty, to yeeld to this Authority, all active and cheerful obedience in the Lord, even for Conſcience ſake, to promiſe (he being required) truth &amp; fidelity to it, &amp; to hold forth the grounds of his ſo doing to any, as God ſhall call him thereunto.</p>
            <p>That though an Impriſonment, accompanied with the loſs of his eſtate, and to be followed (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your gracious prevention) on with a ſpeedy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, before an high &amp; eminent Judicatory, are far from being pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood; and though the enjoyment of your grace and favor be a bleſſing moſt deſerving to be reckoned among the beſt of temporals, yet that neither the feeling &amp; fearing of the former, nor the expectation of the latter, could have induced your petitioner againſt the light of his own judgment, and the prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering part of his own Conſcience to have made, or preſented this acknowledgment; he ſadly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting, that a whole skin is but a contemptible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for a wounded conſcience.</p>
            <p>That nevertheleſs (he truſteth) he ſhall be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in tendring thus far, even his outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to repreſent to your honors, that he is in moſt apparent danger of his irreparable loſs of his health (the ſweeteſt of outward bleſſings) unleſs by your gracious grant, he may ſpeedily injoy a more free and open ayre, then this his cloſe confinement will allow him:</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95150:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And this Chriſtian favor (which even for Chriſts ſake your poor Petitioner moſt humbly beggs) Your Honors are as able to enlarge, even to a pardoning of his offences, and a perfect releaſing of him, from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, as he is ſubmiſſively forward in deſiring them, though confeſſedly far from deſerving them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He nevertheleſs promiſing, that your compaſſionate affording hereof, ſhall be a ſtrong and ſtanding engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, daily beſeeching the heart-making, and heart-changing God, that all thoſe who either through former accuſtomedneſs, or preſent inadvertancy, do not clearly diſcern the minds of God concerning the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Government, may be obſerving your prime and pious induſtry, to advance throughout this</hi> Common-wealth, <hi>the power of godlineſs, a Scripture Reformation, and the Truth as it is in Jeſus, be won to a yeelding to your Honors, conſcionable obedience, and not only in word, but in heart and life, may be true and faithful to the preſent Government.</hi>
